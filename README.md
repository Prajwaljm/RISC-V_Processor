This repository contains three directories for Source code, Block Diagrams and output screenshots respectively. To run the RISC-V Processor put all files of source code in a folder and run RISC_V_PROCESSOR_TEST.v testbench file. If you want to alter the instructions to be executed or instruction memory alter the file [Source_Code/instr.mem](/Source_Code/instr.mem) accordingly.  You can do the same with [Source_Code/data.mem](/Source_Code/data.mem to change data of program that you are executing.
